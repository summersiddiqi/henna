	<p>Henna is a dye made from the Lawsonia inermis plant. It can be used to create temporary body art by colouring the skin with the dye. Henna stains last for a few days after reaching their peak colour, and then they fade away over the course of 1 to 3 weeks. Henna has been utilised for centuries to colour skin, hair, and fingernails, as well as materials such as silk, wool, and leather, since antiquity in ancient Egypt. Henna will not stain skin until the lawsone molecules in the henna leaves are made available (released). If dried henna leaves are mashed into a paste, they will dye the skin. The lawsone will eventually travel from the henna paste into the skin's outer layer, where it will attach to the proteins, resulting in a stain. Natural henna pastes that have only henna powder, a liquid (water, lemon juice, etc.) and an essential oil (lavender, eucalyptus, tea tree, etc.) are not "shelf stable." That means they quickly expire and cannot be left out on a shelf for more than one week without losing their ability to colour the skin.</p>
