	<p>Terry Pratchett was born in 1948 and had his first story published when he was just thirteen. After leaving school at seventeen to become a journalist he continued writing, publishing his first novel, The Carpet People, in 1971 and going on to produce the phenomenally successful Discworld series. Terry proved early critics wrong and became one of the UKâ€™s most successful authors, receiving a knighthood in 2009 and seeing many of his books adapted for the screen.</p>
